/*
    Use dot notation
    Automatic generation of getters/setters
    This class called Student will have properties
    1) this enables you to use dot notation, declare as a property
    This means that there are getters and setters with :readwrite
    nonatomic, no multithreading, no thread safe overhead, save CPU cycles
    readwrite, the getters/setters
    assign and copy, memory management
    assign used for primitive types
    strong/weak used for pointers
 
    tl;dr, what you're doing in the @property lines are telling xcode that
    int age will be an assignment of values to age, nonatomic, and a read/write property.
    The same goes for NSString *name, but the difference is that we're going to use copy
    to copy the data instead of assigning it.
